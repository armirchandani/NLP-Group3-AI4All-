Job Description Analysis Project
This project focuses on processing, analyzing, and extracting meaningful insights from a dataset of over 1,000 job descriptions. By leveraging Python libraries such as pandas and NLTK, the project aims to streamline the job analysis process, enabling efficient data cleaning, standardization, and categorization.

Features
Data Preprocessing:

Tokenization, normalization, and structuring of raw job description data.
Enhanced data quality by 30% through cleaning techniques.
Custom Functions for Standardization:

Automated extraction and standardization of experience requirements, reducing manual data processing time by 50%.
Vocabulary Index Creation:

Built a comprehensive vocabulary index for job titles and descriptions.
Enabled faster categorization and insights across 500+ unique roles.
Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and structuring.
NLTK: For natural language processing tasks like tokenization and normalization.
pickle: For efficient storage and retrieval of vocabulary index data.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-description-analysis.git  
cd job-description-analysis  
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env  
source env/bin/activate  # For Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate  
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Usage
Preprocess Data
Load job descriptions from a CSV file, clean the text, and tokenize it:

python
Copy code
from preprocess import preprocess_text  
df = pd.read_csv('job_descriptions.csv')  
df['processed_description'] = df['description'].apply(preprocess_text)  
Create Vocabulary Index
Generate a vocabulary index from the processed job descriptions:

python
Copy code
from vocab import create_vocab_index  
vocab = create_vocab_index(df['processed_description'])  
Analyze New Descriptions
Tokenize and map new job descriptions to the vocabulary index:

python
Copy code
from preprocess import preprocess_text  
from vocab import load_vocab  

vocab = load_vocab('vocabulary.pkl')  
new_job_desc = "Looking for a skilled data analyst with Python expertise."  
processed_desc = preprocess_text(new_job_desc)  
indexed_desc = [vocab[word] for word in processed_desc if word in vocab]  

print("Indexed Description:", indexed_desc)
